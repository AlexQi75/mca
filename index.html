  <p>“To the Racy Brink,” an exhibition celebrating the 50th anniversary of Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (MCA) unlocked the museum archives to bring back the contemporary art of another era.</p>

   <p>A dozen old exhibit posters decorate the walls in front at the exhibit entrance, like a band of weather-worn stars recalling glorious memories of the past five decades. Vintage televisions feature interview footage with artists such as Luc Tuymans and Mark Bradford. Kodak carousels, like those in the TV show “Mad Men,” flip through slides projected on the wall.</p>

   <p>“We are just trying to give people a flavor of what happened in those days,” said Lynne Warren, museum curator of the show.</p>

   <p>Each piece cast an earthshaking impact on the art scene in their times. Many artistic norms that we take for granted today trace their roots back to the breakthrough ideas showcased by these exhibits.</p>

  <p>Among the works on exhibit, “Art by Telephone” remains one of the most groundbreaking conceptual pieces of its time. Artists called in instructions for making artworks, and MCA staff executed the works avoiding all blueprints and written plans.</p>

   <p>Other installations back then relied heavily on audience participation, such as Arman's famous trashcans. Visitors were asked to contribute their own waste. The work was considered complete once the area is filled to brim.</p>

   <p>“Part of the strength of the telephone show was the variety. If you see these 45 different pieces, it’s almost like a science mission, with all the different technologies that were put on display. And some of them were more or less interactive. And they changed every day,” said David H. Katzive, then Curator of “Art by Telephone”. “It’s more an engaging show, because there wasn’t just one point of view.”</p>

   <p>Sound familiar? It may be the exact words used for any media platform’s campaign today — an interactive product that lets users feel engaged, rather than passively receive information. The most intriguing thing in the world might just be the infinite possibilities of human interaction — that is the basic law that Facebook and Twitter as well as many other social media platforms have profoundly exploited.</p>

   <p>Art venues have also become aware of the importance of tackling the issue of human interaction. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art’s has launched its new “artbot” exhibit. Users can text the artbot a keyword, a dog, a color or an emoji. The artbot runs through its database and text an artwork back to your phone. While it brings art right into people’s hands, it also helps the museum to figure out what people are looking for when they turn to art.</p>

  <p>Francisco Batista, a 23-year-old musician from Argentina, said he enjoyed “Art by Telephone” very much. “I really like the concept of art being about communicating something and also a way of miscommunicating something.”</p>

   <p>He chose to visit MCA over the Art Institute of Chicago to explore new ideas behind avant-garde art. “I think contemporary art is supposed to break the structure of the art before.”</p>

   <p>“Art by Telephone” was produced in the late 1960s, when subversion and deconstruction of classics were at its height due to the ideological trend of postmodernism. The idea of process and experience of artistic creation over an accomplished piece was a break from the traditional norm of an art exhibit and art itself.</p>

   <p>“Museum was not really the right name for it,” Katzive said. “It’s just a gallery for showing contemporary ideas. I don’t even like to tell people we were showing art because there are so many pre-conception ideas about what that means.”</p>

   <p>But after six weeks, all of the works exhibited were either destroyed or disposed of by the museum. Today, all that’s left are the phone call instructions recorded by Katzive.
“It’s a show and it comes down. Nothing lasts. Everything is ephemeral,” said Katzive, Identifying one trend in contemporary art.</p>

   <p>To other visitors, the art is still more like a challenge or surprise that they want to explore across the venue.</p>

   <p>“I don’t think I understand it, but I still want to try. It’s a feast for the eye,” said Linda, who is 51 and visiting from Bettendorf, Iowa. She and another visitor, Gordon, asked us not to post their last names.</p>

   <p>“There are so many things that are unpredictable which just come somewhere and let us be surprised,” said Gordon, 27. He heard about “Doomed” before he came to the current show. But when he saw the footage projected on the wall he realized that the highly controversial performance actually took place at the MCA.</p>

<p>The video documentation of the legendary performance “Doomed” (1975) by Chris Burden is on view for the first time. The artist, who died in 2015, lay in the gallery – still, silent and laying on the floor for 45 hours without food, water, or any communication.</p>
<p>The event challenged the meaning of art and performance. But the story behind the performance carried even more drama.</p>
<p>“It was a big miscommunication,” Warren recalled. “Chris Burden had figured he’d lay there during the museum’s open hours and we’d close the museum as usual, which would end the performance. But he didn’t tell anybody that. So we were like, ‘This is amazing! Let’s keep the museum open.’ We just kept it going and no one told him that we were going to do that either. So he lay there for 45 hours!”</p>
<p>Dennis O’Shea, a museum employee, who currently works as the MCA’s Manager of Technical Production, documented parts of the performance with a rented camera.</p>
<p>“No one knew what it was exactly, but that lack of clarity was, in some ways, a part of what made Burden’s piece so exciting.” O’Shea recalled to Michelle Puetz, a blogger on MCA and the Pick-Laudati Curator of Media Arts at the Block Museum.</p>
<p>Let’s jump from Chicago in 1975 to the other side of the planet, China in 2015. On March 13, Durex held an online live broadcast to promote its latest condom product. In the scene, a young couple appear beside a vending machine and they wait for an entire three hours until the condom drops out from the machine. Then they take it and leave.</p>

<figure style="float:top;">

<p>The three-hour broadcast went viral on the Internet and has generated 19,993 bullet comments, real-time comments that float across the screen. So far, the ad has been viewed 1.17 million times, with a large share of audience members encouraged by curiosity to watch the bullet comments. From “Doomed” to Durex’s viral commercial, it takes 40 years for an avant-garde idea of contemporary art to morph into a pop phenomenon of advertising and cultural consumption.</p>
<p>However, back in 1975, the “Doomed” performance sparked waves of denouncements, inspiring columns by journalist Mike Royko, who lashed out harshly on the show. An article by film critic Roger Ebert noted: “Body artist’ moves fans — out the door.”</p>

<p>Comment cards by visitors are also nicely preserved and presented to reflect the social discussion back then.</p>

<p>“I paid to see this?” one viewer questioned on the card.</p>

<p>“You are a poor misfit. What have you done to help society?” another criticized.</p>

<p>That is a question the Museum of Contemporary Art has been trying to answer in the past 50 years. The venue was one of the first to showcase artist interviews along with their artworks and one of the first to launch education programs that involve people, especially students, in the dialogue about contemporary art.</p>

<p>“[Contemporary art] is a free spot in society, where you can do anything.” Burden said in an interview in 1975, according to a 2007 article in the New Yorker. And museums like MCA are offering the spot for artists who dare to take risks and audience who are willing to try.</p>

<p>“Art museum often really function like theaters,” Katzive said. “What museum would do and critics would do is to see if it’s seemed to help us better understand where we are now and where we are going as a culture.”</p>

<p>Warren, who has been working at MCA for 35 years, recalled the “unprecedented” moment when she felt contemporary art reaching out to average people. It was in 1987 when she heard of the death of Andy Warhol, a leading figure in the pop art movement, while she was shopping at a Goodwill store. “They are announcing this on a local AM radio and I’m in the middle of this second hand store. And they are talking about the contemporary art world.”</p>

<p>In 50 years, contemporary art has skyrocketed in value. Nowadays, museums are given only two years for even long-term exhibits before artworks are moved to private galleries or sold at a big price to collectors.</p>

<p>“It’s a different world now,” Warren said, though this is also the world that many avant-garde artists have envisioned through their works many decades ago.</p>
